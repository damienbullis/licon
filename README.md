### _Icons, but lazier_

Licon is meant to provide just a simple pattern to lazy load & bundle all your icons together. See <a href="#usage">Usage</a>.

<br/>

### _Licon doesn't care_

Licon aims to be icon library agnostic, meaning use your custom icon components, or your favorite icon library. Use what you want, and Licon will handle the rest.

## Install

```sh
# npm
npm install licon

# bun
bun add licon

// TODO: ^^^ Verify these once I publish this package

## Usage

_Let's set up your `<Licon />`_

### 1. Icons & lazy icon

```

## Caveats

Something about vite bundle process
